\usage{
extractTree(
  species = "all_species",
  label_type = "scientific",
  taxonomy_year = 2023,
  version = "1.3",
  data_path = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{A character vector either of scientific names (directly as they come out of the
eBird taxonomy, i.e. without underscores) or of six-letter eBird species codes. Any elements of
the species vector that do not match a species-level taxon in the specified eBird taxonomy
will result in an error. Set to "all_species" if the complete tree is desired.}

\item{label_type}{Either "scientific" or "code".}

\item{taxonomy_year}{The eBird taxonomy year the tree should be output in. Set to "current"
to extract a tree in the most recent taxonomic version. Otherwise, a numeric should be
passed in, e.g. 2021.}

\item{version}{The desired version of the tree. Default to the most recent
version of the tree. Other versions available are '0.1','1.0','1.2','1.3', and can be passed as a character string or as numeric.}

\item{data_path}{Default to \code{FALSE}, it will look for a path containing the bird tree.
If the tree has not been downloaded yet using \code{\link[=get_avesdata_repo]{get_avesdata_repo()}}, it will load the default tree using \code{\link[utils:data]{utils::data()}} and \code{version} and \code{taxonomy_year} will be ignored??
If the tree has been downloaded using \code{\link[=get_avesdata_repo]{get_avesdata_repo()}}, it will read the tree file corresponding to the \code{version} and \code{taxonomy_year} provided and load it as a \code{phylo} object.}
}
\value{
A phylogeny of the specified taxa in the specified eBird taxonomy version and clootl
tree version.
}
\description{
Initial tree processing
}
\details{
This function first ensures that the requested output species overlap with species-level
taxa in the requested eBird taxonomy. If they do not, the function will error out. The onus is
on the user to ensure the requested taxa are valid. This is critical to ensure no unexpected
analysis hiccups later--you don't want to find out many steps later that your dataset doesn't
match your phylogeny.
