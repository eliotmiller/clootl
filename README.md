# clootl
## An R package for interfacing with the clootl tree

This is the future (or maybe just a temporary?) home for the clootl project, a collaboration between the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Open Tree of Life to produce a global avian phylogeny in the Clements taxonomy. 

#### Is the tree ready to use?
No, but it's close. We are working on a number of fronts at the moment, and while the code here works, or should, the tree it is relying on is just a placeholder.
