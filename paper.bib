  abstract = {Functional traits offer a rich quantitative framework for developing and testing theories in evolutionary biology, ecology and ecosystem science. However, the potential of functional traits to drive theoretical advances and refine models of global change can only be fully realised when species-level information is complete. Here we present the AVONET dataset containing comprehensive functional trait data for all birds, including six ecological variables, 11 continuous morphological traits, and information on range size and location. Raw morphological measurements are presented from 90,020 individuals of 11,009 extant bird species sampled from 181 countries. These data are also summarised as species averages in three taxonomic formats, allowing integration with a global phylogeny, geographical range maps, IUCN Red List data and the eBird citizen science database. The AVONET dataset provides the most detailed picture of continuous trait variation for any major radiation of organisms, offering a global template for testing hypotheses and exploring the evolutionary origins, structure and functioning of biodiversity.},

  abstract = {We present a complete, time-scaled, evolutionary tree of the world’s bird species. This tree unites phylogenetic estimates for 9,239 species from 262 studies published between 1990 and 2024, using the Open Tree synthesis algorithm. The remaining species are placed in the tree based on curated taxonomic information. The tips of this complete tree are aligned to the species in the Clements Taxonomy used by eBird and other resources, and cross-mapped to other taxonomic systems including the Open Tree of Life (Open Tree), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The total number of named bird species varies between 10,824 and 11,017 across the taxonomy versions we applied (v2021, v2022 and v2023). We share complete trees for each taxonomy version. The procedure, software and data-stores we used to generate this tree are public and reproducible. The tree presented here is Aves v1.2 and can be easily updated with new phylogenetic information as new estimates are published. We demonstrate the types of large scale analyses this data resource enables by linking geographic data with the phylogeny to calculate the regional phylogenetic diversity of birds across the world. We will release updated versions of the phylogenetic synthesis and taxonomic translation tables annually. The procedure we describe here can be applied to developing complete phylogenetic estimates for any taxonomic group of interest.
Significance statement Birds are charismatic - well loved, and highly studied. Many new phylogenies elucidating avian birds evolutionary relationships are published every year. We have united phylogenetic estimates from hundreds of studies to create a complete evolutionary tree of all birds. While a variety of resources aggregate huge collections of trait, behavior and location data for birds, previously the barriers to linking data between these data resources and bird evolutionary history have limited the opportunities to do exciting large scale analyses. We have bridged that gap, and developed a system that allows us to easily update our understanding of bird evolution as new estimates are generated. We share a workflow and the software needed to create a complete evolutionary tree for any group.},

  abstract = {Scientific names of biological entities offer an imperfect resolution of the concepts that they are intended to represent. Often they are labels applied to entities ranging from entire populations to individual specimens representing those populations, even though such names only unambiguously identify the type specimen to which they were originally attached. Thus the real-life referents of names are constantly changing as biological circumscriptions are redefined and thereby alter the sets of individuals bearing those names. This problem is compounded by other characteristics of names that make them ambiguous identifiers of biological concepts, including emendations, homonymy and synonymy. Taxonomic concepts have been proposed as a way to address issues related to scientific names, but they have yet to receive broad recognition or implementation. Some efforts have been made towards building systems that address these issues by cataloguing and organizing taxonomic concepts, but most are still in conceptual or proof-of-concept stage. We present the on-line database Avibase as one possible approach to organizing taxonomic concepts. Avibase has been successfully used to describe and organize 844,000 species-level and 705,000 subspecies-level taxonomic concepts across every major bird taxonomic checklist of the last 125 years. The use of taxonomic concepts in place of scientific names, coupled with efficient resolution services, is a major step toward addressing some of the main deficiencies in the current practices of scientific name dissemination and use.},
